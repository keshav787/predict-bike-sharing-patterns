# Predict Bike Sharing Patterns

In this project, I have built a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a bike sharing dataset! It focuses on gradient descent, backpropagation.  It was a part of Deep learning Nanodegree by [Udacity](https://udacity.com)  

The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset)

## Setup
 1. Clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/keshav787/predict-bike-sharing-patterns.git
```
 2. Install all the dependencies  
 3. Follow Instructions in [Your_first_neural_network.ipynb](https://github.com/keshav787/predict-bike-sharing-patterns/blob/master/Your_first_neural_network.ipynb)
