# Predict Bike Sharing Patterns

In this project, I have built a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a bike sharing dataset! It focuses on gradient descent, backpropagation. 

The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset)
